Here it goes, my first try at content review:

## The Midnight Sky

2.75/5 Stars

<br>

Why is The Midnight Sky, one of the most visually compelling movies I have ever seen, possibly the greatest waste of my Christmas Day? No one can deny the engrossing acting of George Clooney and his character's endearing (but slightly stilted) chemistry with young Iris. But why can I not bring myself to care at all?

<br>

I'm not an experienced movie reviewer, but I like to think of myself as someone who tries to understand things instead of taking them at face value. 45 minutes into the movie I already wrote it off but I want to figure out what makes a movie good and why this one needs work. I have to admit though that this is one of the most beautiful space movies I have ever seen. The visual design has a realism to it that you could imagine seeing in 2049, but with a delightful dab of retrofuturism and magic. The camera work is sharp with explanatory angles that never leave you wondering about the current events and lighting that makes each frame a painting. The CGI is seamless with your standard but (for a lack of a better word) scrumptious teal/orange color grading. The somber ending credits, while giving you a moment to breathe, drive in a terminal feeling of isolation and are my favorite of all the ones I can remember. But these feats are not enough to make a satisfying movie. Many of my qualms remain with the plot and writing.

<br>

This story is not a completely original one, but I won't hold that against it. I love a good space movie and probably could find myself watching the same movie over and over again but with just a different title and cast. I do believe however that the dramatic changes made in this book went in the wrong direction. When we learn in the early scenes of the movie that the Earth is fucked and the last survivor we can see is a terminally ill man, why do we even bother continuing? From this point on we can feel in our guts that there is little hope for a happy ending. Another space-themed survival movie, The Martian, at least gives us the time of day with the possibility that Watney will find his way back to Earth one day. There is no redemption for this vision of Earth. Even with the new Adam and Eve returning to the livable moon of Jupiter, we only have a second before realizing there is going to be a nasty genetic problem in the comeback story of the Homo Sapiens.

<br>

Some more *basic* problems appear throughout starting with the flashbacks. They are flat-out boring and who the flying *fuck* thought it was a good idea to have Ethan Peck play a young George Clooney? My mother would make a better Clooney. This movie absolutely **nails** the technical, production, and most acting aspects while completely bungling the writing. There are plot twists like the entire hallucination of young Iris which leads to a dissatisfying ending. I would have much rather had the girl be real and stay with the only character I cared about, Augustine, but instead, the movie decides to demolish your feelings, throw away the budding, heart-warming relationship we saw grow over 2 hours, and tear up your last shred of hope at a happy ending. To put salt in the wound, the only other realistic human, Maya, had one of the most illogical death sequences. You would think NASA would choose astronauts who wouldn't be scared of spacewalks and could stay calm under pressure on their mission to the only other livable body in the solar system, but I guess that would be asking for too much. It seems the studio was also too scared to show any real trauma too and resorted to some sort of bleed coming out of the back of the suit, although the floating blood was a pretty great graphic. Finally, there were many unnecessary plot points like the poor man in the airplane full of artwork(why??) or any of the "symbolic" nightmare sequences, which didn't hold with the rest of the plot, while they skipped over writing any sort of absorbing human emotions that make you interested in a movie.

<br>

To put it bluntly, there was no heart to any of the characters in the movie. After spending 2 hours with just these 7 people, I still have a very loose grasp of who they really are. The dialogue is as boring as plain mashed potatoes and any of the actions of any of the Aether characters could be swapped between them and I wouldn't have blinked. There are no personality quirks and consistent idiosyncrasies that humanize the characters. They were just people who act as any person would. I didn't feel like I had any stake in their survival; alive or dead, it did not matter to me what was going to happen to them. But of course, writers are not dumb so they tried to incorporate small actions they would hope would count as personality traits, but oh lord was it painful. There was no creativity and ended up having a couple of jokes that would reach the lowest common denominator. The first time you hear Sully speak to Adewole on the Aether she pulls out the old "You did something bad to me in my dream so I'm not talking to you". So funny right????? I honestly couldn't tell if it was supposed to be sarcastic or not because Adewole took it kind of seriously. And there was the heart-felt moment in every movie where the entire cast starts singing Sweet Caroline and it was so *beautiful* I was moved to *tears*.

<br>

It honestly wasn't a bad movie, but the entire purpose of a movie is to make you feel something. Anything. I've felt an attachment to real people, animals, and even cartoon robots through movies. But somehow this movie couldn't make me feel anything for the last few humans in the universe.
