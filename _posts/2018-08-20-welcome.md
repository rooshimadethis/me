### Welcome to ***rooshi.me***! 😁

<br>

**DMs**: always open. I don't got no social media anymore, but if you do want to talk to me email me at my first name and my last name @gmail.com. No punctuation in between, all lowercase.

**First name**: Rooshi

<br>

It's best place to learn about me or anything I've ever thought about. If you're looking for cute dog pics tho (and maybe some funny and/or politicky memes) you can head over to my twitter account and peep my retweets***.

<br>

***I no longer have any social media. I don't really think it's great for anyone. Therefore, I'm gonna try to make this my main platform and post some updates every now and then. Check out the top tabs: "Gallery" for picture-based posts, "Projects" for any creative or technical projects I've worked on, and "Blog" for those last 2 plus some normal blog-style posts.

<br>

I'll try to add some new features like maybe a comment section. I want to interact with whoever comes across this site. <-- Done. Wow I'm good.

<br>

One last thing, I am not in any sense a trained writer. I'm an entry-level software engineer so like the opposite of a writer. I will occasionally not be following normal grammar rules for the sake of keeping my tone authentic to the little voice in my head.
