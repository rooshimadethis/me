Welcome to *rooshi.me*! 

It's best place to learn about me or anything I've ever thought about. If you're looking for cute dog pics tho you can head over to my twitter account and peep my retweets.



On this website I hope to show off the work I've been doing with a thoughtful writeup instead of handing over a Github link and having them read a readme.md. I also aspire to have my own software company so I will have a list of the utilities I have built and contact for custom websites and apps.

If you're a **recruiter** that happened across my website, I encourage you to checkout the header links and see the work I've put into my personal projects.









# The real 'About me' section



<!--![](/assets/images/rooshicover.jpg)-->
Currently, I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineering and Marketing double major student at The University of Texas at Austin. I've created this website as somewhere to post my own thoughts on anything including movie and book reviews, and writeups of personal projects I'm working on.

This website will always be a work-in-progress and even though it's on the internet, it's mainly for me.
