# Microblog #2: Automation!

<br>In a fit of manic energy after a pretty terrible few days of recovering from COVID, I made a couple of scripts to help with the updates and deployment I make to this blog. Previously, for even a small change I would have to open up my shell, build the site, go copy and paste all the built files into a separate repo, and then commit and push both working and prod repos. It doesn't seem like too much but it is really a PITA with hummus and has really deterred me from working on this site because of the tedium of making updates.

<br>

The scripts are in Python. I don't really like Python that much mostly due to my poor experience with it in my data science course, but there is very little setup and it is quick to implement what you want.

<br>

```
from subprocess import check_output, Popen, PIPE
from datetime import datetime

#1. build the site
buildCommands = "cd D:/Documents2/web/me \n bundle exec jekyll build \n"


#2. copy everything in /me/_site
#3. paste to /rooshimadethis.github.io (overwrite current files)
sourceDirectory  = "D:/Documents2/web/me/_site"
destinationDirectory = "D:/Documents2/web/rooshimadethis.github.io"
cpCommand = "Copy-item -Force -Recurse -Verbose " + sourceDirectory + " -Destination " + destinationDirectory +" \n"


#4. git add and commit both /me and /rooshimadethis/github.io with date and time as commit message
time = datetime.now().strftime("%m/%d/%Y, %H:%M:%S") #current time for commit message
meGitCommands = "cd D:/Documents2/web/me \n git add . \n git commit -m \"" + time + " \" \n git push \n"
prodGitCommands = "cd D:/Documents2/web/rooshimadethis.github.io \n git add . \n git commit -m \"" + time + "\" \n git push \n"


#execute
commands = buildCommands + cpCommand + meGitCommands + prodGitCommands

process = Popen( "powershell.exe", shell=False, universal_newlines=True,
                  stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE )                             
out, err = process.communicate( commands ) 
```

So there ya go. Kind of cool stuff. It really speeds things up for me. Expect maybe a few percent more posts per week now.

 \- I'm grateful for the recovery of myself and my family from this virus.
