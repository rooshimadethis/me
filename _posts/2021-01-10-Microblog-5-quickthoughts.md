# Microblog #5: Introducing Quick Thoughts!

I said at the end of my last post that I would attempt to write a little bit every week. My original aim was to improve my writing skills, but I realized I just wanted to add anything to this site on a weekly basis. It feels like a nice extension of myself that I want to take care of. It's my main outlet for my thoughts now that I have no social media. But thoughts don't only exist in a long format. That's why for the last couple days I have worked on adding a new feature to this site called "Quick Thoughts". It's pretty much a microblogging component to this site for the purposes of getting some quick thoughts out there (obvs). If I find myself with an interesting question or idea that can't be researched and expanded upon, poof, it's a quick thought. Any quip or quote I find entertaining, boom, quick thought. I will be having fun with this. Check it out at [{{ site.url }}/quickthoughts]({{ site.url }}/quickthoughts/). Until next week.
