# Microblog #4: Side Effects of the Information Age

It could be said that I was born from a human, but raised by the internet. I've spent time with my family, but since the age of 13, when I got my first computer, I have most likely spent more time at home on the internet than I did talking to my family. I'm being kinda dramatic though and I'm sure many people can relate to this situation, but maybe with their phones or laptops. But my love for introversion is not the point. I want to talk about the vast information blob that is the internet.

This post is my first attempt at trying to create a little bit of low-grade literature every week. Writing skills are pretty valuable in any situation from work-related documents to gathering your thoughts, so I thought I would start setting a strict schedule of at least one post a week by Sunday night. I've been struggling with recall when it comes to writing. Not really in cases of subject matter but more of proper grammar, syntax, and especially vocabulary even though I feel like I read so many articles and books. I end up googling "XXX synonym" at the rate of 0.8 times per sentence written and it has put a serious damper on my flow and output. I realize though that reading and writing are completely different beasts and each need to be tamed separately. Consuming is much different than recalling and being an expert in one can only get you so far in the other. The good thing, though, is that every single thing we do is a learned skill and you can get better at *anything* by practicing so this weekly posting is my proposed solution.

 \- I'm grateful for more friends than I expected.
