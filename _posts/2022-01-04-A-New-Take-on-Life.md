# How to Have a New Outlook on Life

I can't believe it's been almost a year since I made my last post. I'm pretty embarassed but the fact that not a single person reads these, I don't think anyone was holding their breath for my next post. Anyways, let me bring some positivity to this blog. I think New Years is an apt time for a new perspective and I would like to share some of my thoughts on how you could make your year better too.

I'm usually known, to myself at least, as a fairly pessimistic person. I always had some fluctuating neuroticism, social anxiety, and probably some depression. Never diagnosed because the  timidity from social anxiety stopped me from letting anyone know I was having issues. The same anxiety also stopping me from finding someone I *would* have felt comfortable enough with to let them know I need some help. But the <span title="the ugly part is that it could come back at any time">beauty of [neuroplasticity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6488487/){:rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}</span> is that these past feelings have faded into something a little less memorable than my most vivid nightmares.

I would like to offer what has worked for me in overcoming some of the problems I've been facing for the last decade mostly revolving around feeling like an outsider in society and living according to a voice that wasn't mine. A few tips/activities and perspectives that really changed my life and a way to fit all of these things into your day-to-day:

I believe one of the key factors in living your happiest life is truly understanding yourself. This may sound like some spiritual mumbo or some self-help jumbo, but it's a necessary part of living a happy life. If the necessity of understanding yourself sounds obvious to you, good. I'm glad you agree with me, but let me first explain why it's so important. Every time you make a decision that goes against your gut instinct, you can feel the resistance. Try to feel it next time you deny yourself a fourth piece of chocolate. It feels like a bit of brain fuzz and a hint of frustration. Sometimes this is an objectively good thing like when denying yourself that *fourth* piece of chocolate, or delaying gratification by studying in school instead of doing heroin in the port-a-potty. But sometimes you can feel a shortcoming in the way you live your life. "Your" thoughts tell you that you should be trying harder for the best engineering role you can get out of college and sucking up to your boss to gain the slight chance of that sweet promotion. But you can feel the resistance grow with every day you try to do this. You don't feel like you were meant for this type of life, but the push from your parents, your overachieving friends, and the voice in your brain is telling you to follow a path you don't really want to. Every day you feel like you're living in someone else's life until you either snap or die having wasted the one chance to be who you really are. 

I went through this same exact path. I was in college worrying about the next interview season and my GPA when all I really wanted was some a connection from even one close friend. Even in high school I remember trying to force myself into a random assortment of clubs and volunteering opportunities because it was "the thing you were supposed to do". I only applied to the top three universities in Texas without even visiting or knowing anything about them because it was "the thing you were supposed to do". I'm not even close to finding out what I really want to end up doing with my life, but learning about myself and following my heart in decisions gives me an overwhelming sense of ease in my life that I wish everyone could feel.

The first thing I want you to do is take a personality test. It sounds like another bullshit, psuedoscience, Buzzfeed-type nonsense but it really
