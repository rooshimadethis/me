# How to Have a New Outlook on Life

I can't believe it's been almost a year since I made my last post. I'm pretty embarassed but the fact that not a single person reads these, I don't think anyone was holding their breath for my next post. Anyways, let me bring some positivity to this blog. I think New Years is an apt time for a new perspective and I would like to share some of my thoughts on how you could make your year better too.

## A little background on myself.

### (I wouldn't feel bad if you skipped this :))

I'm usually known, to myself at least, as a fairly pessimistic person. I always had some fluctuating neuroticism, social anxiety, and probably some depression. Never diagnosed because the  timidity from social anxiety stopped me from letting anyone know I was having issues. The same anxiety also stopping me from finding someone I *would* have felt comfortable enough with to let them know I need some help. But the <span title="the ugly part is that it could come back at any time">beauty of [neuroplasticity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6488487/){:rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}</span> is that these past feelings have faded into something a little less memorable than my most vivid nightmares.

<br>

I would like to offer what has worked for me in overcoming some of the problems I've been facing for the last decade mostly relating around feeling like an outsider in society and living according to a voice that wasn't mine. A few tips/activities and perspectives that really changed my life and a way to fit all of these things into your day-to-day:

<br>

I believe one of the key factors in living your happiest life is truly understanding yourself. This may sound like some spiritual mumbo or some self-help jumbo, but it's a necessary part of living a happy life. If the necessity of understanding yourself sounds obvious to you, good. I'm glad you agree with me, but let me first explain why it's so important. Every time you make a decision that goes against your gut instinct, you can feel the resistance. Try to feel it next time you deny yourself something you want but know you shouldn't have like a fourth piece of chocolate. It feels like a bit of brain fuzz and a hint of frustration. Sometimes this is an objectively good thing like when denying yourself that *fourth* piece of chocolate, or delaying gratification by studying in school instead of doing heroin in the port-a-potty. But sometimes you can feel a shortcoming in the way you live your life. "Your" thoughts tell you that you should be trying harder for the best engineering role you can get out of college and sucking up to your boss to gain the slight chance of that sweet promotion. But you can feel the resistance grow with every day you try to do this. You don't feel like you were meant for this type of life, but the push from your parents, your overachieving friends, and the voice in your brain is telling you to follow a path you don't really want to. Every day you feel like you're living in someone else's life until you either snap or arrive at death having wasted the one chance to be who you really are. 

<br>

I went through this same exact path. I was in college worrying about the next interview season and my GPA when all I really wanted was some a connection from even one close friend. Even in high school I remember trying to force myself into a random assortment of clubs and volunteering opportunities because it was "the thing you were supposed to do". I only applied to the top three universities in Texas without even visiting or knowing anything about them because it was "the thing you were supposed to do". I'm not even close to finding out what I really want to end up doing with my life, but learning about myself and following my heart in decisions gives me an overwhelming sense of ease in my life that I wish everyone could feel.

<br>

## 1. Who are you?

The first thing I want you to do is [take a personality test](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test){:rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}. It sounds like psuedoscience Buzzfeed-type nonsense but it really helped me figure out who I was. I thought every person should be a career-driven, outgoing, tough-skinned, strong-willed individual and I was absolutely lost when deep down I felt I was none of those things. I don't know what exactly put those ideas of the ideal person in my mind (I like to blame media, society, my parents), but finding out I was an [INFP](https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality){:rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} was lifechanging for me. I finally felt deeply understood and found a cool (but sometimes depressing) [community](https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/){:rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} of people online that felt the same way I did. My existence felt validated and the pressure of being me was slowly lifted the more I stopped blaming myself for who I was. This advice is really great for people who feel mostly misunderstood or like they don't fit in with their surroundings. The great thing about personality tests though is that even if you do fit in, its easier to find like-minded people giving advice when you add your personality type at the end of your Google search e.x. "dating advice infp" or "productivity advice estj". The world is a lot less lonely when you find other people that think just like you.

<br>

## 2. Observe your true self

With the personality test enlightening you that your thoughts and feelings are valid, it enables you to listen to yourself and unveil your inner wants. This is really the most complex part of this advice I am giving you. It will take years of noting and awareness, but it will guide you on your own true path and not someone else's. This type of awareness is difficult to achieve from the get go and sounds impossible when you don't know where to start. Lucky for us, this problem has been contemplated before. Like a couple thousand years ago. 

<br>

Mindfulness meditation is one of the most powerful tools we as humans have developed in our brief existence on this rock. As our brains grew frontally to give us the blessings and curses of metacognition, we found ourselves tackling a whole new enemy: our own thoughts. The interesting thing though is that our thoughts are not us. They are just a part of us. Have you ever had a thought pop into your head like "man that guy is so ugly" and then immediately feel bad and think "that was so rude of me"? Are you fighting with yourself? No, thoughts are placed into your mind for further consideration by some other being or process. Thoughts are just possibilities and the attention we give to each of them is what really matters. Thoughts can go as easily as they come and distract you from how you actually are in the world.

<br>

Many of us don't really know what is going on in our minds most times. It seems like a buzz of activity that to some is something to distract from. Our phones make it so easy to find something else to do and a few moments of silence feels like torture sometimes. I know that sometimes I'm still scared of the intrusive thoughts that might appear and make me physically wince, so I try to distract myself with podcasts, TV, or articles. However, it is being the neutral observer of your thoughts that can free you from the chaos in your mind and allow you to just be. As soon as you can let go of the negative thoughts and rumination, you can focus on what really matters.

<br>

You stop defining yourself by your past and you stop focusing on a future that doesn't and may never exist. You feel less afraid of your emotions and will see them as a sensor in your body instead of your enveloping state of mind. You will be able to sit with the emotions and feeling and ask what is responsible for this feeling. Any resistance or negative emotions will become apparent and you will be able to ask yourself what the feeling is and why you are feeling that way. You might not be able to define the issues at first, but over time you will realize the patterns. You always get a gutwrenching feeling everytime you think about work or having to meet your parents. Take note of these feelings and you know now what you need to do.

<br>

To actually achieve mindfulness, I recommend an easy introduction: get a subscription to one of the major mindfulness apps. I've been using Headspace for the last year and although I have my issues with it, I've found it invaluable to getting into the mindfulness routine. I highly recommend you set up a daily routine to get the best results. You should be well-rested or otherwise 

<br>

To be fair, I am wholly unfit to be writing a description of the benefits that mindfulness can offer. I am only a year into my practice and a few months ago I felt very capable of handling my thoughts. Today, I feel less confident in my abilities and I even remember having some sort of enlightment previously that I can no longer feel. I would highly recommend checking out the Vox Explained episode for Mindfulness on Netflix for a cool scientific explanation of what mindfulness does to the brain.

Gratitude journals

Exercise and eating more.

How to fit all of these into your day. Structured app or equivalent 

Life is not a series of problems to fix. Maybe put this in the conclusion paragraph
