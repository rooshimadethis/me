It is finally inauguration day. It should be said, though, that no matter what internal challenges and turmoil we see on the news, we are a remarkably stable country. As long as a majority of the population is dedicated to having the system and country exist, it will, even if the current "ruling" party does not align with some of their political beliefs. It is surely that most would rather have any America than none at all, and with the interconnectedness we have now that was not present in 1861, it is almost certain.  But, that does not mean we stay passive as citizens. Being in that majority means we need to be active and assertive to keep our liberties and make sure those liberties apply to every citizen of this country.
